A4WD3 Rover WASD keyboard example.

In order to use this example you need a serial terminal which doesn't require you to press "Enter" between each keyboard inputs.
We greatly suggest Putty (https://www.putty.org/)

Putty Setup:
  1. Download & Install Putty (https://www.putty.org/)
  2. Setup a Serial session with your COM port and at 115200 (default) speed
  3. Navigate in "Terminal" option and in "Line discipline options" then select "Local line editing: Force off"
  4. Alternatively you can set "Local echo: Force on" as well
